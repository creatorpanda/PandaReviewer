Ok, this script is so cool and useful I wish I could hire Phil Swift or Anthony Sullivan to convince you, but I cannot afford it so I will do it myself! Let's begin!

***"Why do I need this?"***
Because you can scan any PC's specs, anytime! No disassembling, no Googling, no searching are required! Just run this light script and it will do everything for you! 

Here is **some** of the information this script can find for you:

1. Serial Number
2. Product ID
3. Original Product Key!!!
4. OS Version
5. System Type
6. BIOS Version
7. System and Input Locale
8. Motherboard's manufacturer, name, model, version, etc.
9. CPU's name, model, data width, etc.
10. RAM's capacity, memory type, etc.
11. GPU's name, model, and status
12. All Storage Devices' file system, total size, free space, etc.
13. Screens' name, resolution and status
14. Physical Address
15. WLAN/LAN Adapters' description
16. IPv4
17. IPv6

*The idea behind this script came up while chatting with a classmate about which PC parts I should buy to upgrade my old, trusty, and heavily tortured toaster. He asked me for information such as GPU and motherboard models, to help me decide. I couldn't remember the motherboard's name and I couldn't find it in "Settings". That meant I had to do some disassembling, which I was bored doing again (I had searched again for the motherboard model name). So I looked up a **cmd command** that would help. I found it and **ran it in a bat file** cause it was too long to type. It was proven useful. So then I wanted to take it a step further and make a **more detailed spec finder** that'd **help others** solve such problems too!*

And that's how PandaReviewer was born! :D

*I believe that this is going to help many **repair technicians**, and helping is what I love doing!*

***SUPER WARNING!!!: Your Windows Defender (or other programs) may tag this file as "not safe" or something and try to prevent you from running it (maybe because it digs for the PC's specs). Don't worry, it's a false positive! It's safe!***

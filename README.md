Ok, this program is so cool and useful I wish I could hire Phil Swift or Anthony Sullivan to convince you, but I cannot afford it, so I'm going to do it myself! Let's begin!

*The idea behind this program came up while chatting with a friend and coworker about which pc parts I should buy to upgrade my old, trusty and heavily tortured toaster. He asked me about information such as GPU and motherboard model names. I couldn't remember the motherboard's name and I couldn't find it in "Settings". That meant that I had to do some disassembling, which I was bored to do again (I've had seached again for motherboard model name). So I looked up for a **cmd command** that would help. I found it and **ran it in a bat file** cause it was too long to type. It was proven useful. So then I wanted to take it a step further and make a **more detailed spec finder** that'd **help others** solve such problems too!*

And that's how PandaReviwewer was born! :D

***"Why do I need this?"***
Because you can scan any PC's specs, anytime! No disassembling, no Googling, no searching are required! Just run this light file and it will do all the job for you! 

*I believe that this is going to help many **tech support** people, and helping is what i love doing!*

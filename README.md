Ok, this program is so cool and useful I wish I could hire Phil Swift or Anthony Sullivan to convince you, but I cannot afford it, so I'm going to do it myself! Let's begin!

*The idea behind this program came up while chatting with a friend and ~~classmate~~ coworker about which pc parts I should buy to upgrade my old, trusty and heavily tortured toaster. He asked me about information such as GPU and motherboard model names, to help me decide. I couldn't remember the motherboard's name and I couldn't find it in "Settings". That meant that I had to do some disassembling, which I was bored to do again (I've had seached again for motherboard model name). So I looked up for a **cmd command** that would help. I found it and **ran it in a bat file** cause it was too long to type. It was proven useful. So then I wanted to take it a step further and make a **more detailed spec finder** that'd **help others** solve such problems too!*

And that's how PandaReviewer was born! :D

***"Why do I need this?"***
Because you can scan any PC's specs, anytime! No disassembling, no Googling, no searching are required! Just run this light file and it will do all the job for you! 

*I believe that this is going to help many **tech support** people, and helping is what I love doing!*

***SUPER WARNING!!!: Your Windows Defender (or other programs) may tag this file as "not safe" or something and try to prevent you from running it (maybe because it digs for the PC's specs). Don't worry, it's false positive! It's totally safe!***

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and run "PandaReviewer.bat".
